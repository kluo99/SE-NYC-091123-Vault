<h1 align="center"><b>P3 Jupyter Notebooks</b></h1>
<h4 align="center">For students of Cohort <b>SE-NYC-091123</b>.</h4>

## Summary 💬

This subsection contains Phase 3 Jupyter Notebooks for walking through newly curated primary lecture content for in-class activities.

**These notebooks are not a substitute or analog of the Phase 3 Canvas materials!**

Rather, they are a preferred resource for instructional walkthroughs of in-class content, with a particular emphasis on getting exposure to Python syntaxes. 

Additionally, many notebooks double as slides and tutorials that you can access after class or in the event of missing an in-class session.
